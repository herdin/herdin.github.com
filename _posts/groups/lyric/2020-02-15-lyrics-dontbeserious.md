```
Wake
Heavy pulse
Bloody eyes
Sweaty clothes
New routine
That I've learned
To understand and know
Play my tricks
Fragile mind
Rest your head
On me
Shut my eyes
I'm not here
There must be some mistake
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Watch your words
Turn to dust
As we forget
As we move on
Still
I refuse
To let you slip away
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Don't be so serious
Magnets
Magnets
Magnets
Magnets
